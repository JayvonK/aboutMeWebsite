<!-- Mini Challenge - About You with Style -->
<!-- For this mini challenge what I did was basically made a divs inside of a div to customize where the images and texts on my website were place, and also just used an ordered and an unordered list for my information about myself-->
<!-- Peer Reviewed By: Joseph Poncini Peer Review Comments: Webpage looks very nice. Code has atleast 10 unique tags and has links to your social media. I really like the image in the background and the positioning of the images and text. Overall this looks very advanced -->
